This folder(originally called 'savedOutput1'), was created to save data
generated with Stefan Karlsson's and Josef Bigun's OPTICAL FLOW TOOLBOX. 
 
The toolbox is in Matlab, is free for non-commercial use, and can be downloaded here: 
http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/44400-tutorial-and-toolbox-on-real-time-optical-flow

To view the data: in main folder of the toolbox(in Matlab), type "flowPlayBack(nameOfDir)", where nameOfDir
is the name of the directory you have found these files. If they are in the original location, then type:

flowPlayBack('savedOutput1');

To access data: the first frame of the saved data:

[im, u, v, macroDat] = getSavedFlow(1, nameOfDir);

where "im" is the grayscale image, "u" and "v" are the component images of the flow, and "macroDat" contains a description of the data

The n-th frame is thereafter accessed as:

[im, u, v] = getSavedFlow(n);

you can also quickly access succesive frames without giving frame number:

[im, u, v] = getSavedFlow();


   EXAMPLE 1: display the saved video

[im, u, v, macroDat] = getSavedFlow(1, 'savedOutput1');
hIm = imagesc(im,[0 255]);
colormap gray; axis image; axis off;
for fr = 2:macroDat.nofFrames 
  [im, u, v] = getSavedFlow();
  set(hIm,  'CData' ,im);
  pause(1/15);
end
clear getSavedFlow;


   EXAMPLE 2:  Open the code for function "flowPlayBack.m", it is in the folder "HelperFunctions"
